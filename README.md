# My sql-training repository

This repository holds my training .sql files. I created while attending a series of courses (please see the list below) in the platform [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/). **I do not hold complete authorship of every line of code in these files, they are just a few results from my training**.
